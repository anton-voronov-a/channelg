            <ol>
              <li>The extension blocks videos and playlists on the YouTube homepage, in the subscriptions section, on the video search page, in YouTube trends, on the channel page, and on the video viewing page. Blocking is done by blurring the text information and hiding video thumbnails.</li>

              <br />
              The equalizer is useful if you want to improve audio data or compensate for sound output device limitations. It is also used for music.
            </span>

              Volume normalization is available in the short video section under the "Normalize" button, as well as when using the equalizer in the "Equalizer" dialog.
              <br />
              This is useful when there is a loud or quiet speaker in a video. Volume normalization eliminates the need to manually adjust the volume for different videos, as this extension automatically adjusts the volume. Normalization is particularly useful in the short video section, where there are many videos with varying volume levels. In some cases, new sounds can be heard that were not audible before normalization.

        <li>Log into Google using the extension button next to the address bar. This way you can securely save the extension data on your Google drive. All functions, except synchronization with Google Drive, can work without logging into Google.</li>
        <li>Go to Your YouTube Subscriptions and follow the instructions in the panel that appears to help you group your channels. If you only need analytics, blocking videos on YouTube using a filter or sound effects, then you don’t need to configure anything else, everything will work even for anonymous YouTube users.</li>
      </ol>


      <div class="cg-question">
        Have you ever subscribed to just keep the link?
      </div>
      <p>
        Of course, in this case, you start receiving video from this channel. But what if you don't want to receive any videos. You can copy the link to the channel instead of subscribing to it, but then you need to save this link somewhere. In such cases, it would be better to simplify the addition of the link. Using this extension, you can group YouTube channels without subscribing, as a result, you can find it by the link. The changes will be saved to Google Drive, so you can find this link from other devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a rule, if you have at least one news subscription, then you have more than a dozen new videos every day. This can make it much more difficult for you to find a new video on a different topic. But it would be strange if a person liked to hear news from one channel. For more objective information, you should have several news sources.
      </p>

      <div class="cg-question">
        What's stopping you from using YouTube subscriptions for all the news?
      </div>
      <p>
        Obviously, the main problem is the inability to remove all news videos if the news is no longer needed. This application is a Youtube Subscription filter extension that allows (in YouTube) group subscriptions and hierarchy creation. For example, all news can be combined together, thereby separating them from other topics. If necessary, you can (in YouTube) filter subscriptions excluding this YouTube folder on the panel, as a result you will be able to see videos from other YouTube folders.

      <p>
        High-quality content is often very difficult to produce, which is why bloggers rarely release such content. For example, science videos may come out less than once a month. It's okay to use a large number of these sources if you like science videos. Sometimes there may be several hundreds of such sources, and the frequency of video output from them will often be several times less than that of one news source.
      </p>
      <div class="cg-question">
        What is the problem if you want to receive high quality content?
      </div>
      <p>
        The problem is that unlike the news example, in this case you are using a large number of video sources. This extension, by organizing YouTube channels, allows you to use the YouTube channel grouping function, supplementing the YouTube subscription manager to create the necessary structure of all sources, which will be used to search by category, topic, content quality, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes you see a video on the main page or among those suggested by a search engine, and you understand that you do not trust this source of information and you do not want to waste your time on any video from it.
      </p>
      <div class="cg-question">
        What YouTube features allow you to stop wasting time on obviously bad content?
      </div>
      <p>
        There is an opportunity to like the video on YouTube, after which you can find this video in a special playlist. If you put a dislike, then you will not see the playlist for the videos you disliked, but you can see the dislike for this video. YouTube also has the ability to create playlists, so you can basically add bad videos to playlists.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, YouTube has the ability to subscribe to a channel, and you will receive videos from this channel in YouTube subscriptions.
      </p>

      <div class="cg-question">
        How can these YouTube features help us to avoid watching videos from bad YouTube channels?
      </div>
      <p>
        We add only videos to playlists, if new videos from this channel come out, this will not help us much in determining that the channel is not suitable for us, since a new video has not been added to the playlist. But, of course, we can understand that there is no need to watch a video that has already been added to the playlist or which has been disliked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subscribing to a channel gives us the opportunity to create a label about the channel, but the label does not give us enough information. If we use the fact of subscription as information that we do not like the channel, then we will lose the opportunity to use YouTube subscriptions for their intended purpose and everything that we get in the YouTube subscriptions section will be from those YouTube channels that we do not like.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can be concluded that it seems that it is simply impossible to mark YouTube channels as bad.
      </p>

      <div class="cg-question">
        How do I mark YouTube channels as bad?
      </div>
      <p>
        In order for this opportunity to appear, you need to use this extension. As in the operating system, we use the trash bin for garbage. Likewise, for bad content, we can use the YouTube folder for trash. We need to create a YouTube folder for spam or junk and place the selected channels there. In other words, we need to group YouTube channels that we consider garbage. The name of this YouTube folder (group) is located on the video viewing page, so by organizing YouTube channels in this way, you can immediately understand what quality this video is.
      </p>


      <div class="cg-question">
        Since this feature is so necessary, why didn't YouTube implement it?
      </div>
      <p>
        In the past decade, YouTube has made a similar feature and now you can even find some mentions of it. But this feature has been removed from YouTube.
      </p>

      <div class="cg-question">
        How can you save time watching videos?
      </div>
      <p>
        While watching videos, you often get enough information to save you time. You should not lose the information you receive. Typically, you need data to predict something. And data is the experience you get as a result of your viewing. At first glance, it may seem that by liking the clip you are doing something useful for yourself because you keep your impressions. But it will not help you much if you want to decide whether to watch a new clip from this channel or not.
      </p>
      <iframe class="cg-embedded" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-JXUdTV4tW0?start=2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>
        In order to find a solution, you need to link your impressions to your subscription by grouping with other channels. This will allow you to quickly find suitable clips, and will save you time if you figure out which broadcasts are unnecessary for you. This extension allows you to achieve this goal by ranking and organizing YouTube channels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me show you an example. Let's say you are already subscribed to a channel that releases many new clips every day, but most of the clips do not interest you. You know that the program you want comes out once a week. You have to get a lot of extra videos six days a week for one show.
      </p>
      <p>
        This extension gives you the ability to hide unnecessary items with one click. All you need is to add the channel to the YouTube folder and include it in the filter when you need it.
      </p>

      <div class="cg-question">
        What do you do when you have a lot of elements?
      </div>
      <p>
        If we are talking about a file, then you usually put it in a folder. Let's imagine we have a lot of subscriptions. Have you seen a folder for them somewhere? In such cases, we can (on YouTube) group subscriptions to create a hierarchical structure by organizing YouTube channels into categories (YouTube folders).
      </p>
      <iframe class="cg-embedded" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CPuQMmbIfj4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>
        This application extends the capabilities of the YouTube subscription manager, which is available on the subscription management page. Organizing YouTube channels (subscriptions) using categories like folders. This feature is very similar to the YouTube collections removed in the last decade. But unlike collections, the data you create is stored on Google Drive, so you manage it. You can make a backup or sync with your computer just like a regular file on a Google drive. If you want, you can even see what's inside the file or delete it completely.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to YouTube folders, this application also has the ability to manage YouTube subscriptions (channels) using the rating.
      </p>


      <div class="cg-question">
        Why do we need a rating?
      </div>
      <p>
        With the help of YouTube folders (groups), we can already (in YouTube) filter subscriptions and give them meaning. But the information about the group when filtering does not provide such possibilities that the indication of a numerical value does.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you (in YouTube) filter subscriptions by group, then you simply click on the corresponding checkbox in the filter, and if you need a different category, then you are looking for another checkbox, it may be at the end of the list or at the beginning, in other words, far from the previous one. Then you try to find the third group and again waste your time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case of ranking, you change the minimum value of the channel rating in one place, and you do not need to search for the group checkbox inside the tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, you can give a higher rating to YouTube subscription / channel, whose shows you always want to see, and a lower rating to those you can skip. Depending on how much time you have, you can simply change the minimum value with one button to see the programs for which you currently have time. If you have more time, then you can use the same button, which changes the minimum value.
      </p>
      <iframe class="cg-embedded" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3kDe3oHGPa8?start=2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>
        The name of the Youtube folder helps you to use the desired topic when filtering, and the rating helps to limit the list of videos regardless of the topic.
      </p>

      <p>
        This application has the ability to save links to comments.
      </p>

      <div class="cg-question">
        Why do we need comments?
      </div>
      <p>
        Let's say you watched the video and realized that there was something in it that you liked. You have liked or added a video to the playlist so as not to lose it. You may have even used a YouTube folder to give you an idea of what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day you will start looking at everything that you once liked and try to understand what exactly interested you in the video. Let's say you are interested in one minute of this video. And you are trying to find it among the entire video, and it is quite long. It turns out that you are wasting time looking for what you have already found before. How can you prevent this from happening in the future? You can comment on a video using timecodes for specific moments. Therefore, if you commented the first time you saw a given moment and saved a link to it, you would not waste time searching again.
      </p>

      <div class="cg-question">
        Why do we need to link comments to a YouTube subscription or channel?
      </div>
      <p>
        Now let's pretend that you recognize something in the video that characterizes the channel as a whole. For example, you saw that the video contains inappropriate behavior. In this case, you can of course finish watching and hope that in the future you will not be offered videos from this channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's say you were out of luck and you again received a video from this channel, but you liked it. To save your time, you need to unsubscribe from part of YouTube subscriptions, and you are trying to figure out: do you need this channel.
      </p>

      <div class="cg-question">
        How do you know if a channel is really good or bad?
      </div>
      <p>
        It is necessary to leave written notes about the moments you liked and did not like.
      </p>
      <iframe class="cg-embedded" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BERqOREHOks?start=2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>
        This extension allows you to bind a YouTube comment to a channel. As a result, you will have a kind of editable channel dossier, consisting of the YouTube comments that you have chosen. These comments do not have to be written to yourself.
